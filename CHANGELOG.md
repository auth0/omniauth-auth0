# Change Log

## [v2.0.0](https://github.com/auth0/omniauth-auth0/tree/v2.0.0) (2017-01-25)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/auth0/omniauth-auth0/compare/v1.4.1...v2.0.0)

Updated library to handle OIDC conformant clients and OAuth2 features in Auth0.
This affects how the `credentials` and `info` attributes are populated since the payload of /oauth/token and /userinfo are different when using OAuth2/OIDC features.

The `credentials` hash will always have an `access_token` and might have a `refresh_token` (if it's allowed in your API settings in Auth0 dashboard and requested using `offline_access` scope) and an `id_token` (scope `openid` is needed for Auth0 to return it).

The `info` object will use the [OmniAuth schema](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth/wiki/Auth-Hash-Schema#schema-10-and-later) after calling /userinfo:

- name: `name` attribute in userinfo response or `sub` if not available.
- email: `email` attribute in userinfo response.
- nickname: `nickname` attribute in userinfo response.
- image: `picture` attribute in userinfo response.

Also in `extra` will have in `raw_info` the full /userinfo response.
