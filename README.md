# OmniAuth Auth0

An [OmniAuth](https://github.com/intridea/omniauth) strategy for authenticating with [Auth0](https://auth0.com). This strategy is based on the [OmniAuth OAuth2](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth-oauth2) strategy.

> :warning:  **Important security note:** This solution uses a 3rd party library with an unresolved [security issue(s)](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-9284). Please review the details of the vulnerability, including [Auth0](https://github.com/auth0/omniauth-auth0/issues/82 ) and other recommended [mitigations](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth/wiki/Resolving-CVE-2015-9284), before implementing the solution.

## Documentation

- [Ruby on Rails Quickstart](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/webapp/rails)
- [Sample projects](https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-rubyonrails-sample)
- [API Reference](https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/omniauth-auth0)

## Installation

Add the following line to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'omniauth-auth0'
```

If you're using this strategy with Rails, also add the following for CSRF protection:

```ruby
gem 'omniauth-rails_csrf_protection'
```

Then install:

```bash
$ bundle install
```

See our [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for information on local installation for development.

## Getting Started

To start processing authentication requests, the following steps must be performed:

1. Initialize the strategy
2. Configure the callback controller
3. Add the required routes
4. Trigger an authentication request

All of these tasks and more are covered in our [Ruby on Rails Quickstart](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/webapp/rails).

### Additional authentication parameters

To send additional parameters during login, you can specify them when you register the provider:

```ruby
provider
  :auth0,
  ENV['AUTH0_CLIENT_ID'],
  ENV['AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET'],
  ENV['AUTH0_DOMAIN'],
  {
    authorize_params: {
      scope: 'openid read:users write:order',
      audience: 'https://mydomain/api',
      max_age: 3600 # time in seconds authentication is valid
    }
  }
```

... which will tell the strategy to send those parameters on every authentication request.

### Authentication hash

The Auth0 strategy will provide the standard OmniAuth hash attributes:

- `:provider` - the name of the strategy, in this case `auth0`
- `:uid` - the user identifier
- `:info` - the result of the call to `/userinfo` using OmniAuth standard attributes
- `:credentials` - tokens requested and data
- `:extra` - Additional info obtained from calling `/userinfo` in the `:raw_info` property

```ruby
{
  :provider => 'auth0',
  :uid => 'auth0|USER_ID',
  :info => {
    :name => 'John Foo',
    :email => 'johnfoo@example.org',
    :nickname => 'john',
    :image => 'https://example.org/john.jpg'
  },
  :credentials => {
    :token => 'ACCESS_TOKEN',
    :expires_at => 1485373937,
    :expires => true,
    :refresh_token => 'REFRESH_TOKEN',
    :id_token => 'JWT_ID_TOKEN',
    :token_type => 'bearer',
  },
  :extra => {
    :raw_info => {
      :email => 'johnfoo@example.org',
      :email_verified => 'true',
      :name => 'John Foo',
      :picture => 'https://example.org/john.jpg',
      :user_id => 'auth0|USER_ID',
      :nickname => 'john',
      :created_at => '2014-07-15T17:19:50.387Z'
    }
  }
}
```

### Query Parameter Options

In some scenarios, you may need to pass specific query parameters to `/authorize`. The following parameters are available to enable this:

- `connection`
- `connection_scope`
- `prompt`
- `screen_hint` (only relevant to New Universal Login Experience)

Simply pass these query parameters to your OmniAuth redirect endpoint to enable their behavior.

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to easily:

- implement authentication with multiple identity providers, including social (e.g., Google, Facebook, Microsoft, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, etc), or enterprise (e.g., Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS, SAML, etc.)
- log in users with username/password databases, passwordless, or multi-factor authentication
- link multiple user accounts together
- generate signed JSON Web Tokens to authorize your API calls and flow the user identity securely
- access demographics and analytics detailing how, when, and where users are logging in
- enrich user profiles from other data sources using customizable JavaScript rules
